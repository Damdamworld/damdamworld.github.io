### Project Overview
For my IT curriculum, I developed a tool that visualizes how different algorithms navigate a maze. 

#### Key Features:
* **Multiple Algorithms:** Comparative analysis between BFS, DFS, A-Star, and more.
* **Real-time Visualization:** Built using the `pygame` library to show the search process.
* **Performance Metrics:** Tracking steps taken and time elapsed for each algorithm.

#### Technical Stack:
* **Language:** Python
* **Library:** Pygame
* **Concepts:** Data Structures, Graph Theory, Search Optimization.
